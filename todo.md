# To Do

- Make drawing faster
    - Rectangles draw way too slow
- Add more algorithms
- Add more bias functions
- Abstract renderer away from maze stuff

- Add Drawable thing
- Try lowering framerate
    - Can we stop drawing when nothing has been marked dirty? Maybe some kind of drawing queue can be used.
    - We don't need the program to have any more than maybe... 15 FPS. Manually staggering this would make things run more efficiently.
